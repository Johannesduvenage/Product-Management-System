# Product-Management-System
In a factory to track and manage orders which are undergoing several stations to build a complete product.

# Process
Industry named Different Hair Industry PVT LTD. It build a complete WIG from raw hair. To build that the raw hair goes under several process and stations. I am providing a bar code for each order thay got. So from the barcode they can easily know which product or order is present in which station.

They also need different types of forms like employees working performence and so on.

While starting the process they enter weight of the hair provided for that product. In each and every station it is refreshed by entering the weight that is going to start in that station.

So that we can easily calculate the loss of weight in each station and even workers effeciency.
